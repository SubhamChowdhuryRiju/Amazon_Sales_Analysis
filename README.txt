README


I have created a database named "amazon" and a table named "sales." I then imported the CSV file and executed the SQL queries attached in the zip file named "Amazon_Sales_Analysis_SQL.sql" These queries can be executed directly.

Additionally, there is a PowerPoint presentation (Amazon Sales Analysis.pptx) included for the important Amazon sales analysis.
